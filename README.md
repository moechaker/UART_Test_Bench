# UART_Test_Bench

This repository contains a SystemVerilog test bench and related files to verify the functionality of a UART (Universal Asynchronous Receiver-Transmitter). The test bench is designed to rigorously test the UART's behavior under different data rates, transmission modes, and error conditions to ensure its correct operation.


## Introduction

The UART Test Bench project focuses on verifying the proper functioning of a UART, a critical communication module for serial data transmission. The test bench generates diverse test scenarios.

## Important Notes
- PLEASE NOTE THAT I HAVE NOT WRITTEN THE DESIGN, I HAVE ONLY VERIFIED IT
- design.sv IS NOT WRITTEN BY ME
- EVERYTHING ELSE IS DONE BY ME
- sorry for shouting that out lol, I just wanted it to be seen

## Usage

To run the FIFO design verification test bench, follow these steps:

1. Visit this link: https://www.edaplayground.com/x/J3Ph
2. Top right, hit login and create an account
3. Eda Playground might open a new playground for you, so go ahead and click on my link again to open my playground
4. On the left, click on "Open EPWave after run" under Tools & Simulators if you wish to analyze the waveforms
5. hit Run

During the simulation, the test bench will generate UART data transmissions, applying a range of input data. The design's output will be monitored and compared against expected results to identify any anomalies or discrepancies.
